## Project: Priorit ~~ies~~ y Habit Tracker

Have you ever decided to revamp your life, started on a bunch of new habits, and then failed at all of them? Or lost motivation at the same time you lost your "streak?" This website aims to help with that by forcing you to pick _**one**_ habit to work on, reporting your progress with a streak-loss-proof metric (days since starting * frequency), and encouraging competition with friends to see who can stick with it best.
