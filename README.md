## Project Proposal: Priorit ~~ies~~ y Habit Tracker

Have you ever decided to revamp your life, started on a bunch of new habits, and then failed at all of them? Or lost motivation at the same time you lost your "streak" and couldn't take starting over again? This website aims to help with that by forcing you to pick _**one**_ habit to work on, reporting your progress with a streak-loss-proof metric (days since starting * frequency), and encouraging competition with friends to see who can stick with it best. 

### Features

### Technology Use

- **Authentication:** The website will use an username and password to create an account, which will have their habit history associated with it.
- **Database data:** A database will be necessary to populate the chart showing their habit history (filling in the block for each of the days that they reported doing it). Additionally, the database will store their "score," which will be shown in the leaderboard.
