# Notes for CS 260

Consol:
- Vim:
  - copy a line is yy
  - paste a line is p
  - 0 takes you to the front of a line, A to the end
  - :u is undo
- Scripting:
  - Functions: writen as function_name() {...}, new terminal window to use

Git/GitHub:
- Run `git config pull.rebase false` to merge conflicts
   - Conflicts only occur when the exact same line has been changed - otherwise it can combine them without any issues

Remote shell to web server:
- ssh -i cs260_key.pem ubuntu@52.72.74.101
